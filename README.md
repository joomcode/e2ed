E2E testing framework over [TestCafe](https://testcafe.io/).

## Install

Requires `node@16` or higher:

```sh
npm install e2ed --save-dev
```

## Usage

### CLI

First create the necessary initial structure of directories and files in the project,
with a sample test and pageObject (all the code related to `e2ed`
will be in the `e2ed` directory in the root of the project):

```sh
npx e2ed-init
```

Then run tests locally for `https://google.com`:

```sh
E2ED_ORIGIN=https://google.com npx e2ed
```

And run tests for `https://google.com` in docker:

```sh
E2ED_ORIGIN=https://google.com ./e2ed/bin/runDocker.sh
```

### Config

The config is defined in the file `e2ed/config.ts`.
You can locally override some config fields in an `e2ed/overrideConfig.ts` file that is not included in the repository.

#### Required config fields

`liteReportFileName: string | null`: the name of the file under which, after running the tests,
the lite JSON report will be saved in the `e2ed/reports` directory, for example, `lite-report.json`.
If `null`, the lite report will not be saved.

`printTestLogsInConsole: boolean`: if true, print test logs to the console (literally in console.log).

`reportFileName: string | null`: the name of the file under which, after running the tests,
the HTML report will be saved in the `e2ed/reports` directory, for example, `report.html`.
Also this name is used as the title of the report page.
If `null`, the report will not be saved.

`skipTests: SkipTests`: this setting allows you to describe a set of skipped tests in a custom form.
You can define the `SkipTests` type and `skipTests` processing rules in the hook `e2ed/hooks/isTestSkipped.ts`.

`testLogsFileName: string | null`: the name of the file under which, after running the tests,
the test logs will be saved in the `e2ed/reports` directory, for example, `test-logs.log`.
If `null`, the report will not be saved.

`testRunExecutionTimeout: number`: timeout (in milliseconds) for each individual test run.
If the test run takes longer than this timeout, the test fails and rerun on the next retry.

### Environment variables

`E2ED_ORIGIN`: origin-part of the url (`protocol` + `host`) on which the tests will be run. For example, `https://google.com`.

`E2ED_API_ORIGIN`: origin-part of the backend API url that can be used by tests to create and delete test entities.

`E2ED_CONCURRENCY`: the number of browser windows in which tests will run in parallel (1 by default).

`E2ED_DEBUG`: run e2ed in nodejs-debug mode (`--inspect-brk=0.0.0.0`) if this variable is not empty.

`E2ED_DOCKER_DEBUG_PORT`: debug port when run in docker (9229 by default).

`E2ED_DOCKER_DO_AFTER_TESTS`: the name of the executable file from the `e2ed/bin` directory that will be run (into container) after running the tests.

`E2ED_DOCKER_DO_BEFORE_TESTS`: the name of the executable file from the `e2ed/bin` directory that will be run (into container) before running the tests.

`E2ED_DOCKER_IMAGE`: the name of the docker image used to run tests with the `your-project/e2ed/bin/runDocker.sh` command
(`e2ed` by default).

`E2ED_DOCKER_RETRIES`: the maximum number of retries to run a failing test with the `your-project/e2ed/bin/runDocker.sh`
command (maximum value 50, 5 by default). For example, if it is equal to three, the test will be run no more than three times.

`E2ED_NAVIGATE_STABILIZATION_INTERVAL`: after navigating to the page, `e2ed` will wait until
the page is stable for the specified time in milliseconds (maximum value 120 000, 2 000 by default).
